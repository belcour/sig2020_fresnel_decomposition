This repository contains the supplemental Jupyter notebook associated with the SIGGRAPH 2020 Talk *Bringing an Accurate Fresnel to Real-Time Rendering: a Preintegrable Decomposition* and the [SIGGRAPH 2020 PBS Course](https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2020-shading-course/). It contains the python code to produce Fresnel reflectance models using a data-driven basis decomposition. You can directly see the notebook [here](https://github.com/belcour/sig2020_fresnel_decomposition/blob/master/notebook.ipynb).
